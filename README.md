# electron-boilerplate

This is my personal boilerplate for Electron/React applications. 🚀

I try to use the latest versions of the npm libs included in it (but sometimes I'm not able to keep it updated).

## Available npm commands:
- Start development for react application only: `npm run start:render`
- Start development for electron application: `npm run start`
- Build, bundle and package application: `npm run build`

## Libraries installed:
- react and react-dom for interface development 🖼
- webpack for bundling 📦
- webpack-dev-server for development runtime 🔩
- electron for multi platform distribution 🚀

I try to start new projects from scratch from this boilerplate, so I try to be completely unopinionated regarding the npm ecosystem: no direct dependencies are installed apart from react and the ones mentioned above. This means there is no test libraries installed! If you use this boilerplate don't forget to install your favorite tests library.

Feel free to use it!

Hope you enjoyed it ❤️
